Render unto the computer the tasks that are computational.

In today's future of journalism trends, considerable discussion is given to: Will computers replace us. This course takes an emphatic "no" or at least, "not if we can help it."

The impetus for this class comes from a 2010 essay by chessmaster Garry Kasparov, most famous for representing humankind's most solid defense against machines. He ultimately lost, an dseveral years later in this essay, accepts that "the supremacy of the chess machines."

But he notes that as humans can never beat machines in brute force, humans can and still win based on the human-decision. KAsparov remarks on the surprise winner of a "freestyle" chess tournament, in which

## On technical skill

In many ways, this class will seem like "computer science lite". This is due to design -- some of the students will have finished Public Affairs Data Journalism with no prior programming experience outside of Excel formulas and SQL syntax.

But there's a 


- Create a Github account, read up on how to contribute to an open source project, and successful make a pull request
- Type, type, type.
- Common ground with the command-line
  


## Characteristics of a successful project

- Automation
- Determinism
- Recognition of the problem space
- The use of Structured data
- Mathematical certainty





## Philosophy

Some thoughts about what this class is about

### Strong machines and weak humans

The motivations of this course can be found in a 2010 New York Book Review essay penned by Garry Kasparov, the Russian chessmaster who was one of humankind's most famous final fronts against computer domination in a series of chess matches versus Deep Blue.

> Having a computer partner also meant never having to worry about making a tactical blunder. The computer could project the consequences of each move we considered, pointing out possible outcomes and countermoves we might otherwise have missed. With that taken care of for us, we could concentrate on strategic planning instead of spending so much time on calculations. Human creativity was even more paramount under these conditions.

> Weak human + machine + better process was superior to a strong computer alone and, more remarkably, superior to a strong human + machine + inferior process.

Kasparov's essay gives us insight on how, in the face of brute computational force, humans can succeed. So while others wonder whether computers will replace reporters, we use computers as they were meant

What we aim to do in this CompCiv is much less sophisticated than emulating a chess player. 

We aim to use a computer for ways 

> She understood even better than Babbage did what the potential of this machinery was. Babbage was always thinking in terms of just numbers. Ada thought it might not just be numbers. You could have words or music or anything that could be expressed in the form of symbols and these machines could operate on them.

> In this Ada saw what none of her contemporaries, Babbage included, appear to have seen. Ascribing this essential and historic understanding to her is not a backwards projection from our own age. She is explicit. This is Ada, banging the table, saying it is this that is significant and revolutionary about automatic computation. So Lovelace is rightly celebrated but not for the reasons commonly cited.



## What does this have to do with journalism

There's not many fields in which journalism 

There are no all-encompassing algorithms that can capture the messiness of data. We don't deal with APIs, we deal with documents. We need functions on top of functions to find inaccuracies. For us, there are no single algorithms that will, no app that will read a pr

While others contemplate some fear of computers replacing reporters






 
### Recommended prerequisites


- Be able to work with a plain-text editor, such as Sublime Text
- Operate a *nix system to 







I think of this as hand-held computing.


#### Requirements

In the fall, the journalism graduate students have all taken Public Affairs Data Journalism and will have had a good grounding in Structured Query Language. Understanding the need to be explicit with a computer is 

Students from other majors, coming in with more technical expertise.

The common ground is that both groups know how to tinker, both have an interest in civic affairs.





### Coding is required

Programming isn't the answer to everything. But it's the answer for everything that requires programming.

What requires programming? Any task that can be more quickly done by a computer. Much of this course will be identifying this. Theoretically, a class could be taught in which we sit around and dream up of solutions that programmers could do. but what's the fun in that?

A popular catchphrase is "no coding required." Make a game with no coding required. Scrape a webpage with no coding required. Build an app, no coding required.

This is not to say that programming is the answer to everything. But it's the answer to a lot of things that we hope to solve. If something can be done without programming, it means one thing was done very well, such as snapping a photo

Programming isn't the answer to everything but it's the answer to a _lot_ of things that we hope to solve. The problems in this course will not be of the variety in which you can "download this app onto your iPhone and push this button".


Programming isn't just an intellectual pursuit, it is a skill that comes from the recognition that computers are powerful, but _dumb_, and when we want to do interesting things. We tell it too. IT is a skill of creation, of imposing our belief and our process.


### Sample problems

So what are the kind of problems that can be solved with equal part human intuition, layperson understanding of algorithms, and augmented by human wisdom?


- Notifying you when a page has changed
  - an OK solution. You write a command line tool that saves a list of pages to your hard drive.
    + a better solution. You write a cron task
    + Sligthly better, you connect the output of that cron task to an email service.
    + Even better: you take the 30 seconds it takes to figure out what part of the page you actually care about, and you figure out what tag is what and your notifier works off of that.


- Counting bylines and analyzing gender
- Finding a proper lede photo


### Keys of a successful solution

- Open and explainable
- Automatic and deterministic
- Minimalist and intentional
- Wise and realistic 

### Projects we admire

- NewsDiff
- Supreme Court diff
- Earthquake bot
- Propublica's instagram
- ProPUblica's Free the Files
- Newshound


- fun ideas:
  + stop tweeting during class
  + Eliza bot
