# The Skeptical Command Line

The Skeptical Command Line is a free, online guide on using the [Unix shell, e.g. the command-line interface, e.g., the **CLI**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell) to perform powerful computational tasks related to the seeking, analysis, and publication of information.

This guide is written and produced by [Dan Nguyen](http://danwin.com), who can also be reached via Twitter: [@dancow](https://twitter.com/dancow).


## Why the UNIX shell?

(*TBD*)

- Legacy
- Ubiquity
- Portability
- Design
- Power

Unix [was initially released more than 40 years ago](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) and today, its descendants and derivatives continue to [power a non-declining swath of our digital world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems), including the majority of supercomputers, mobile phones, web servers, and laptops seen at Brooklyn coffee shops.

## Coverage

*TBD*

## Intended audience

This guide is intended for both non-programmers and programmers who are otherwise unfamiliar with the command-line interface.

If you've tried and struggled to learn programming, whether it be Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, etc., the CLI offers a high-level way to do the kind of unique computing tasks that you're ostensibly wanting to do via a programming language. The CLI requires a lesser understanding of computer science concepts than does programming, while at the same time, the CLI will be much more powerful and flexible than what you've done using consumer-friendly operating systems (e.g. Mac OS X, Windows, iOS).

(Note: once you get past CLI one-liners, you will essentially be doing programming, but it's not worth arguing over semantics here.)

If you already know the CLI, you'll find many of the early sections to be too slow and simplified to be worth following. However, if you've been using the CLI mostly out of necessity (i.e. server administration), I hope some of the practical applications this guide covers will introduce you to new situations where the CLI can be applied.

## Other resources

The __Skeptical Command Line__ is not meant to supercede, but to compelment the existing, excellent CLI guides, including:

- [Practical Unix](http://openclassroom.stanford.edu/MainFolder/CoursePage.php?course=PracticalUnix) - A practical introduction to using the Unix operating system with a focus on Linux command line skills. This is a Stanford University class that's been released as an open-curriculu.
- [Software Carpentry's The Unix Shell](http://software-carpentry.org/v5/novice/shell/index.html): this is one section of an ambitious, comprehensive open-source guide with the purpose of making "scientists more productive, and their work more reliable, by teaching them basic computing skills."
- [Sysadmin Casts](https://sysadmincasts.com/): this excellently-well-produced screencast focuses more on system administration, such as server configuration, deployment, security, and logging &ndash; tasks which the command-line is well-suited for and thus, inextricably associated with.
- [Commandlinefu](http://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/browse): A crowdsourced repository of useful tricks and hacks with the command-line.
- [The Art of Unix Programming](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/) - This is more of a treatise than a practical user guide, but its eloquent advocacy for "The Unix Way" is what convinced me to learn and appreciate the command-line.
