title: The Skeptical Command Line
description: Learning how to compute one task at a time
---

The Skeptical Command Line is a free, online guide on using the Unix command-line interface to perform powerful computational tasks related to the seeking, analysis, and publication of information.

I am writing The Skeptical Command Line to complement the computational journalism classes I will be teaching at Stanford starting in Fall 2014. I knew that most students couldn't be expected to learn enough (useful) programming during their coursework. At the same time, it's near impossible to take advantage of computational power without having a way to teach or tell the computer what you want it to do.

The command-line interface, abbrevated as CLI, is an accessible (if not user-friendly) way to converse with computers, such that real-world information-related work can be done by users who know conceptually what they need to do, and, how painful it would be without a computer's assistance.

Along the way, non-programmers will get a better sense of why they'd even want to learn programming. But learning the CLI is not intended to be an intellectual exercise, but a powerful way to solve problems.


## The UNIX Philosophy, condensed

Adapted from Eric S. Raymond's [distillation of the UNIX philosophy](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html#id2877917):


1. Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
2. Write programs to work together.
3. When in doubt, use brute force.
